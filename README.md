# README-Generator

## Description

A node inquirer app that allows the user to input data that fills out a professional readme.md

* Wanted to make a simple program to create readme.md files without having to worry about markdown syntax.
* Creates a markdown file with proper syntax. Headings, lists, etc.
* Throughout this project I learned how to impliment the inquirer program in Node. This was my first project using Node.
